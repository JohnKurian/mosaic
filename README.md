# Mosaic
Mosaic is a Python library for pipeline optimization. This library implements Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm in order to find optimal pipeline.

[Documentation](https://herilalaina.github.io/mosaic/)

### Installation

Requirements
* Python >= 3.5.6
* pygraphviz: necessary to generate dot image files (optional)
```commandline
conda install graphviz
pip install pygraphviz
```

Install via Github:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/herilalaina/mosaic
```


### Example of usage: machine learning
A simple example of using `mosaic` to configure machine
learning pipeline made with PCA and SVM classifier.

```bash
python examples/machine_learning.py
```

### Citation
If you are using `mosaic` in a academic presentation, we would appreciate citation
